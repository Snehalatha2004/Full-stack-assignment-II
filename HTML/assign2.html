    <h1>WELL COME TO HOMEPAGE</h1>
    <p>There are ten different types of wool fiber that can be processed to create even more varieties of wool
        materials. The kind of wool fabric you see in the store depends on the animal it originates from. Sheep wool
        includes virgin wool, merino wool, and Shetland sheep's wool. Cashmere and mohair come from goats.7 Feb 2023
