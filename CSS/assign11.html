            <p style="background-color: black; color: greenyellow;">4.Wool is a textile fibr obtained from sheep and some other animals, including cashmere and mohair from
                goats, qiviut from muskoxen, angora from rabbits, and other types of wool from camelids. Wool fibre is a
                highly organised structure whose main histological components include the cuticle, cortex and medulla.8

                Wool is a natural material. People use wool fiber to make clothing, blankets, and other things to keep
                warm. It is usually used to make outer clothing but is also used to make blankets, socks, sweaters and
                fine clothing. Rabbit wool is called angora wool.
                Wool is a type of fabric derived from the hairs of various animals. While most people associate the word
                “wool” with sheep, there are, in fact, a variety of distinct types of wool that producers derive from
                animals other than sheep. To make wool, producers harvest the hairs of animals and spin them into yarn.
                Wool is "the fiber from the fleece of the sheep or lamb or hair of the Angora or Cashmere goat (and may
                include the so-called specialty fibers from the hair of the camel, alpaca, llama, and vicuna) which has
                never been reclaimed from any woven or felted wool product".

                There are ten different types of wool fiber that can be processed to create even more varieties of
                wool materials. The kind of wool fabric you see in the store depends on the animal it originates from.
                Sheep wool includes virgin wool, merino wool, and Shetland sheep's wool. Cashmere and mohair come from
