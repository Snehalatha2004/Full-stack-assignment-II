        4.Wool is a textile fibr obtained from sheep and some other animals, including cashmere and mohair from goats,
        qiviut from muskoxen, angora from rabbits, and other types of wool from camelids. Wool fibre is a highly
        organised structure whose main histological components include the cuticle, cortex and medulla.8 Nov 2020
        Wool is a natural material. People use wool fiber to make clothing, blankets, and other things to keep warm. It
        is usually used to make outer clothing but is also used to make blankets, socks, sweaters and fine clothing.
        Rabbit wool is called angora wool.
        Wool is a type of fabric derived from the hairs of various animals. While most people associate the word “wool”
        with sheep, there are, in fact, a variety of distinct types of wool that producers derive from animals other
        than sheep. To make wool, producers harvest the hairs of animals and spin them into yarn.
        Wool is "the fiber from the fleece of the sheep or lamb or hair of the Angora or Cashmere goat (and may include
        the so-called specialty fibers from the hair of the camel, alpaca, llama, and vicuna) which has never been
        reclaimed from any woven or felted wool product".
