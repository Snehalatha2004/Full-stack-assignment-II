        The film mostly takes place on a KTX from Seoul to Busan as a zombie apocalypse suddenly breaks out in the
        country and threatens the safety of the passengers. The film premiered in the Midnight Screenings section of the
        2016
        Train to Busan is surprisingly good. The acting is great, the special effects, while not being the best were
        good enough, the movie was very entertaining, the characters were genuinely likeable and the ending was soul
        crushing. If you're into zombie movies and you haven't seen this one, you should definitely watch it
        The biggest theme that emerged was selfishness vs. Sacrifice. Some people live life looking out for themselves,
        while others consider the needs and interests greater than their own. The greatest villains embody selfishness
        while the greatest heroes embody.
